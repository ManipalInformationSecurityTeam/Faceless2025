## Solution Approach

1. **locket**
    - There are two songs and both of them contain the answer. You notice that `Just Another Day` is released on the day Maya was murdered. You listen to the song, and notice the lyrics: `found a locket, tucked it away`. That's the answer.
    - *Hint:* Listen to the music very carefully.
2. **doremi**
    - The person who Maya is chatting with has the name `C D E` and her bio is `sound of music`. You Google search `C D E sound of music` to get results mentioning `doremi`. Do re mi is the western notation of the notes CDE.
    - *Hint:* Go through C D E's profile.
3. **dhareni**
    - The chat has mentions of a place called `lareti`. It also has doremi referring to that to tell Maya to practice sargam and do Indian music. So, western notation contains `Do Re Mi Re Fa So La Ti` equivalent to Indian `Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni`. Compare to get the word `dhareni`.
    - *Hint 1:* It's non-technical, just apply conversion logic.

4. **Nocturne**
    - There's another song named `thirteen steps` released before. Its lyrics have the letters pronounced `ABPGHEAR`. You reverse Rot13 this to get the word `Nocturne`. That's the answer.
    - *Hint:* Listen to the music very carefully.
5. **paras**
    - One of the songs has metadata that contains a direct Telegram link of a channel selling online products. You go to its `Discussions` chat to find an ongoing chat between 2 people. It should be possible for anyone else to join without approval. The chat contains coordinates of a lane having a machine tools shop called Paras. There is a fasteners shop beside for which hint is given in chat.
