## Solution Approach
1. Perses
    - This connects Level 5 to Level 6. From the screenshot, you need to visit the Pinterest profile of *Pradyumna Dangwal*:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/nMdY0WG8/6A-sol1.png)  
    
    - On his profile, you see he's collaborated on a pinboard with *Arjun Bhujiawala* and has several gods pinned. Digging deeper into *Arjun Bhujiawala's* profile, two profiles stand out â€” *Roonil* and *Prakhar Agarwal*.  
    
    - When you inspect these profiles, *Prakhar Agarwal* has created only one pin:

    - From the comment there, you can narrow down *Perses* as Pradyumna's favourite god.

2. Cumbum
    - From Pradyumna's Pinterest profile, head to his GitHub account linked there:  
    https://github.com/pradyumna-dangwal  
    
    - Browsing through his public repositories didn't reveal much, so the next logical step was checking hidden data in a GitHub profile like gists:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/0R7fHhDX/6B-sol1.png)  
    
    - Going to:  
    https://gist.github.com/pradyumna-dangwal  
    
    - We find a gist listing the place where Pradyumna hails from:

3. Idiocracy
    - On Pradyumna's GitHub, a branch named `v1.1` had a description linking to a Letterboxd profile:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/dv32Zg1/6C-sol1.png)  
    
    - On this Letterboxd page:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/6cH6zh3B/6C-sol2.png)  
    
    - I browsed the reviews where one explicitly states the movie:

4. William_Jacobs
    - Initially, no collaborators were visible in the repo list. However, checking the commit history revealed a collaborator on a project called `neural shadownet`:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/wZg4fmdy/6D-sol1.png)  
    
    - The collaborator's name: *Arjun Bhujiawala*:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/MxFqmm0m/6D-sol2.png)  
    
    - His bio says: *A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential.*
    
    - This is a line from the song *Dance with the Devil* by *Immortal Technique*. The character's full name is *William Jacobs*.

5. Hand_Covers_Bruise
    - In Arjun's profile, a repository named `GO_Codes_Dump` had a branch `obscure codes`. Checking the commit history revealed a Spotify playlist link:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/JFkB9y3V/6E-sol1.png)  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/9HRj7rMv/6E-sol2.png)  
    
    - After trying songs in this playlist, I checked the playlist description, which had a link to another playlist:  
    ![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Xf0dwttV/6E-sol3.png)  
    
    - This playlist contained only one song:
