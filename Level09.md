## Solution Approach:

1. 17-11-1997 (Birthday)

- Start from Naksh Karwall's *Inkit* account where there are **four stories**:
  - *Echoes Of Bell*
  - *The Pale Horse*
  - *The Cost Of Silence*
  - *Fish - The Queen Of The Sea*

  the three stories (*The Pale Horse*, *The Cost of Silence*, and *Fish*) contain the answers

- In the **About Section** of Inkit  is a link to his Reddit account: [Reddit: u/StarshinesKar28](https://www.reddit.com/user/StarshinesKar28/).

- On **Reddit**, his profile links to his **Tumblr**:

- A blog post on **Tumblr** leads to his **Sakurajima.moe** account:
  [Sakurajima Profile](https://sakurajima.moe/@starshineskar28)

- On **Sakurajima.moe**, Bible verses were posted, each corresponding to one of the stories:
  - *Fish - The Queen Of The Sea*:
    Matthew 4:19 → Chapter 4, Line 19 →
    “It was cold, The season of Advent was setting in, the month of **November**.”
  - *The Cost Of Silence*:
    Revelation 6:10 → Chapter 6, Line 10 →
    “I was considered to be a bright mind, after all it was the **International Students Day**.”
    → International Students Day is **November 17th**.
  - *The Pale Horse*:
    Revelation 6:8 → Chapter 6, Line 8 →
    “...after all, the princess died the same year I was born — the most loved and cherished of them all.”
    → Princess Diana died in **1997**.

- Combining:
  - **Month:** November
  - **Day:** 17
  - **Year:** 1997

2. Silhouette (Operation Name)

- Now you have access to Naksh’s Reddit, Tumblr, and Sakurajima accounts.

- On **Tumblr**, there is a post about the band **Queen**, showing a poster of their song *Bohemian Rhapsody*:
  [Tumblr Bohemian Rhapsody Post](https://www.tumblr.com/starshineskar/780529632266092544/this-has-been-an-inspiration-for-me-no-matter?source=share)

- On **Reddit**, there is a cryptic **poem**:
  [Reddit Poem Link](https://www.reddit.com/user/StarshinesKar28/comments/1jwnrhx/if_a_name_is_what_you_seek_please_do_take_a_peek/)

- The poem’s first line mentions **3:07**.

- Play *Bohemian Rhapsody* and pause at **3:07** — the word at that timestamp is **Silhouette**.

3. Dante’s Inferno (Favourite Poem)

- Across all of Naksh’s posts and stories, the themes include **death, judgment, revenge, and hell**.

- **Reddit Post:**
  [The Descent Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/StarshinesKar28/comments/1jxdic8/the_descent/)
