## Solution Approach:
> Follow this narrative trail to get the solutions:
### 1. Starting Point: LeetCode Profile
- You begin with Vedika’s **LeetCode profile**.
- It links to her **public Tumblr blog**, titled `Unstable Symmetry`.
### 2. Tumblr Trail → GitHub Identity
- A later post on `Unstable Symmetry` reveals Vedika’s **GitHub handle**: `kwaesthim`.
- This leads you to her **GitHub repositories**, where:
  - Project **Iridescence** is repeatedly mentioned in commit messages.
- Another post on the blog contains a **password-protected link** to a second **private Tumblr blog**.
  - The **password** is embedded in the **tags** of the same post (`#passwordisfun`).
### 3. Suspicion Raised: Zayan Farooqui
- In the **comments section** under Vedika’s profile:
  - A user named **Zayan Farooqui** posts:
    > "Fascinating paper... but I could’ve sworn I read parts of this logic in an old draft shared by A. Shah during the 2023 Q-Sim dev thread..."

  - This is the **first red flag** publicly linking Ashna to the stolen work.

### 4. Final Stop: Singularity (Personal Website)
- Q.net also contains a link to Vedika’s personal site: **Singularity**.
  - The site includes abstract poems and essays themed around:
    - **Professional jealousy**
    - **Obsession**
    - **Rivalry**
  - It begins to unravel her emotional spiral and obsession.

### 5. Motive Exposed: Shadowframe Diary
- Finally, the **web-diary** titled **Shadowframe** is uncovered.
  - The diary contains symbolic entries, metaphors, and obsessive musings.
  - While it never outright confesses, the tone, content, and metaphors **heavily imply her motive** and **her role in Ashna’s murder**.
